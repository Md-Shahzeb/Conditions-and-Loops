Q1. What are Conditional statements?Explain conditional statements with syntax and examples?
Ans: They help in making decisions in the code, enabling the program to take different actions depending on the evaluation of conditions.
The Conditional statements in JavaScript are:
 	* If Statement:-The if statement executes a block of code if a specified condition is true.
			    Syntax: if (condition)
					 {

						}

				Example:-  let age=18;
						if (age>=18)
						{
						   console.log("you are adult...");
						}
		
	* if else Statement:- The if...else statement is used to specify a block of code to be executed if the condition is true,
				    and another block of code to be executed if the condition is false.
				   Syntax: if (condition) {
						  // code to be executed if the condition is true
						} else {
  						// code to be executed if the condition is false
						}
				Example:- let x = 10;
						if (x > 15) {
  						console.log("x is greater than 15");
						} else {
  						console.log("x is not greater than 15");
						}

	* if else if else Statement:- The if else if else statement is used to specify multiple conditions.
			Syntax:-    if (condition1) {	
					  // code to be executed if condition1 is true
				      } else if (condition2) {
  					// code to be executed if condition2 is true
			      	} else {
  					// code to be executed if both condition1 and condition2 are false
					}
			Example:-   let x = 10;
					if (x > 15) {
  					console.log("x is greater than 15");
 					} else if (x > 5) {
  					console.log("x is greater than 5 but not greater than 15");
					} else {
 					 console.log("x is 5 or less");
					}
	* switch statement:- The switch statement is used to perform different actions based on different conditions. it is often used as an 
				   alternative to a complex "if...else if...else structure.
			Syntax:-	switch (expression) {
     					case value1:
    					// code to be executed if expression === value1
    					break;
  					case value2:
    					// code to be executed if expression === value2
  				      break;
				     // additional cases
  					default:
  				    // code to be executed if expression doesn't match any case
				   }
			Example:- let day = 3;
					switch (day) {
  					case 1:
  					  console.log("Monday");
    					  break;
				     case 2:
   					  console.log("Tuesday");
    					  break;
  				     case 3:
    					  console.log("Wednesday");
    					 break;
  				    case 4:
    					 console.log("Thursday");
   				      break;
  				    case 5:
    					console.log("Friday");
   				     break;
 				   case 6:
    				     console.log("Saturday");
    				    break;
  				  case 7:
    				    console.log("Sunday");
        			    break;
 				 default:
    				   console.log("Invalid day");
				}
